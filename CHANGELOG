   Fixed:
 ! Building by the old GCC in FreeBSD;
 ! Building by the GCC with RedHat DSO Linking patches;
 ! The module failed to work with file AIO;
 ! Subrequest processing (failed to work with the SSI module before);
 ! Proper 500 status code returning in case of various errors;
 ! Display of instruction pointers in VM log errors;
 ! "Accept-Range" header clearing;
 ! The module could cause problems with chunked transfer encoding;
 ! The bug that causes the module to fail on x86_32 Linux systems;
 ! A number of bugs that cause errors up to getting server stuck in a loop in various situations and configurations.

   Improved:
 * VM initialization at server startup phase (each request caused initialization in earlier versions);
 * Bufferization code was fully rewritten and "ctpp2_data_buffer" option to define the size of data buffer was added;
 * Template errors logging.

   Added:
 + "templates_root" option to set templates root folder;
 + Ability to set template in config file (due to "template" option);
 + Template simple checks before execution and, in addition, "templates_check" option to enable Ð¡RC32 template checking;
 + Various VM configuration options;
 + Tests;
 + Useful build and test scripts.
